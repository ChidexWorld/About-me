I am a full-stack developer and a current student of Computer Science with two years of experience in tech. I specialize in building scalable and efficient solutions for complex technical challenges.

I am proficient in the JavaScript programming language and TypeScript, and I enjoy using the React framework for its modular structure, which simplifies maintenance and provides flexibility. I also have expertise in EJS, Express.js, and SQL for backend and database management, enabling me to deliver complete and robust applications.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing table tennis and the trumpet.
