I am a passionate Full-Stack Software Engineer and a Computer Science student with over 3 years of experience in tech. I specialize in developing intelligent, scalable, and efficient solutions that solve real-world problems.

I have strong expertise in JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python, with experience using React, Express.js, EJS, FastAPI, and SQL to build full-stack applications. My growing interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) drives me to create innovative systems that combine data-driven intelligence with modern web technologies.

Outside of coding, I enjoy playing table tennis and the trumpet.
